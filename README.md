Using the Evo Voice console platform there are a few features we wanted such as app-izing the web page vs having a tab in the browser window.  Another was desktop notifications when a call comes in.  

This project simply loads the console page in as an electron app so you can keep the app open.  It also provides desktop notifications of 'direct call' for incoming calls.  I wanted to add the caller id but wasn't able to fully extract it from the console log.

This code is use at your own risk/convenience.
